TO ADD REMOTE REPOSITORY
steps:
1.- create keys
2.-validate keys if server is working
3.-let the system know that we have a key
4.- connect git hub with public key


git remote add origin (ssh url)
gir remote
gir remote -v
git push origin main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v0.1 -m "mensaje" hash
git push origin --tags
git push origin :refs/tags/dormido

rebase - rebase is like merging but it replace all the changes
stash - it saves all the changes that you do but not as a commit, just similar, also you can create a branch from 
there

git clean borra las cosas innecesarias

git cherry-pick, is like a merge but you can select a hash that doesnt matter if is in the begginning

git reflog is a total history of everything

git commit --amend -> it inserts the last add to the last commit that already was did it

git grep -> look for text or files in all the repositro
git log -S "word" -> similar to grep
